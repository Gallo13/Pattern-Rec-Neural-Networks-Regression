# Pattern-Rec-Neural-Networks-Regression
Regression (Linear, Multiple, Quadratic, Cubic, etc) Using Logistic Regression for Prediction

Requirements:
1. Number of attribtues in dataset should not be less than 5 and the number of instances(rows) be no less than 300. Pick dependent variable
2. Dataset must be split into 3 subsets: approx training(70%), validation(20%), testing(10%).
3. For data preprocessing (onlt training and validation sets) you can use StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, RobustScalar, Normalizer.
4. Use gradient decent and sinusoidal activation function.
5. Use fitting measure R-squared and normalized confusion matrix for testing set.
6. Visualize all results with matplotlib and/or seaborn.
